# Elements and Tags

## opening and closing tags

HTML documents are made up of elements represented by HTML tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). Elements can be paired (with an opening and closing tag) or self-closing.

#### Heres an example

```
<tagname attribute="value">Content goes here</tagname>
```

## Self closing tag

Self-closing elements don't have a separate closing tag because they don't contain content between opening and closing tags. Instead, they use a forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket (>).

#### Heres an example

```
<selfclosingtag attribute="value" />
```
