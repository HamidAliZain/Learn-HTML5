# Unorder List

An unordered list in HTML is created using the <ul> (unordered list) element. This element is used to create a list of items where the order doesn't matter. Each item in the list is represented by a <li> (list item) element. Here's how you can create an unordered list

```
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

```
