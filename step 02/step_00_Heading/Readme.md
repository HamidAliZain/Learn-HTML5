# Headings

In HTML, headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of content on a webpage. HTML provides six levels of headings, ranging from <h1> (the highest level) to <h6> the lowest level. Here's how you can use them:

```
<h1> Headings <h1/>
<h2> Headings <h2/>
<h3> Headings <h3/>
<h4> Headings <h4/>
<h5> Headings <h5/>
<h6> Headings <h6/>

```
