# Headings

In HTML, headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of content on a webpage. HTML provides six levels of headings, ranging from <h1> (the highest level) to <h6> (the lowest level). Here's how you can use them:

```
<h1><h1/>
<h2><h2/>
<h3><h3/>
<h4><h4/>
<h5><h5/>
<h6><h6/>
```
