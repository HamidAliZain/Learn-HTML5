# Links

In HTML, you can create links using the <a> (anchor) element. Here's the basic syntax:

```
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>

```

The href attribute specifies the URL that the link points to.

The text between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag is the visible link text that users will see on the webpage.

```
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>

```

If you want the link to open in a new tab or window, you can use the target attribute:

```
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in New Tab</a>

```
