# Order List

In HTML, you can create ordered lists using the element. An ordered list is a list of items where each item is automatically numbered. Each list item is represented by the element. Here's how you can create an ordered list:

```
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

```
