# Footer

The footer element in HTML is used to define the footer section of a webpage. It typically contains information such as copyright notices, contact information, and other content that is often found at the bottom of a webpage. Here's an example of how you can use the footer element:

```
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 My Company. All rights reserved.</p>
        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a></p>
    </footer>
```
