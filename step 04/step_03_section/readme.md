# Section

The section element in HTML is used to define a thematic grouping of content on a webpage. It's typically used to divide content into distinct sections that share a common theme or topic. Here's an example of how you can use the section element:

```
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a team of dedicated professionals...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>We offer a wide range of services including...</p>
        </section>
    </main>
```
